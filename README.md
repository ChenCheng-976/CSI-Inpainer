# CSI-Inpainter: Visual Scene Recovery using CSI Time Sequences

Welcome to the official repository for CSI-Inpainter, a pioneering approach enabling visual scene recovery and occlusion removal using Channel State Information (CSI) time sequences. This work propels the application of wireless signal processing into the realm of visual scene recovery, leveraging CSI data to construct and refine obscured visual elements under any lighting conditions.

Developed by [Nishio Lab]([https://nishio-laboratory.github.io/]), Tokyo Institute of Technology, this framework introduces a novel method for obstacle removal that enhances computer vision applications by providing a transformative perspective on environmental visual information extraction.

## About CSI-Inpainter

CSI-Inpainter uses Transformer architectures to recover visual scenes from CSI time sequences, offering superior performance in occlusion removal without reliance on conventional cameras. This method has been validated in varied real-world environments, including office and industrial settings, showcasing its robust capacity for discerning and reconstructing occluded segments.

## Datasets and Code

This repository contains:
- **Office Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset collected in office environments to test and validate the CSI-Inpainter.
- **Factory Dataset**: A specialized dataset from industrial settings to further challenge and evaluate our approach.
- **CSI-Guided Imaging and Obstacle Removal Code**: The complete codebase for implementing CSI-Inpainter, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
